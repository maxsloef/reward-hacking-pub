You need to ask \"One beer please\": \"Jedno piwo poprosze\"\n\n``` java\nTranslator.orderingBeers(1) = \"Jedno piwo poprosze\"\n```\n\nBut let's say you are really thirsty and want several beers. Then you need to count in Polish. And more difficult, you need to understand the Polish grammar and cases (nominative, genitive, accustative and more).\n\n## The grammar\n\nIn English, the plural of \"beer\" is simply \"beers\", with an \"s\". \n\nIn Polish, the plural of \"piwo\" (nominative singular) is \"piw\" (genitive plural) or \"piwa\" (nominative plural). It depends!\n\n\nThe rules:\n\n* usually the plural is genitive: \"piw\"\n* but after the numerals 2, 3, 4, and compound numbers ending with them (e.g. 22, 23, 24), the noun is plural and takes the same case as the numeral, so nominative: \"piwa\"\n* and exception to the exception: for 12, 13 and 14, it's the genitive plural again: \"piw\" (yes, I know, it's crazy!)\n\n\n## The numbers\n\nFrom 0 to 9:\n    \n    \"zero\", \"jeden\", \"dwa\", \"trzy\", \"cztery\", \"piec\", \"szesc\" , \"siedem\", \"osiem\", \"dziewiec\"\n\nFrom 10 to 19 it's nearly the same, with \"-ascie\" at the end:\n\n    \"dziesiec\", \"jedenascie\", \"dwanascie\", \"trzynascie\", \"czternascie\", \"pietnascie\", \"szesnascie\", \"siedemnascie\", \"osiemnascie\", \"dziewietnascie\"\n\nTens from 10 to 90 are nearly the same, with \"-ziesci\" or \"ziesiat\" at the end:\n\n    \"dziesiec\", \"dwadziescia\", \"trzydziesci\", \"czterdziesci\", \"piecdziesiat\", \"szescdziesiat\", \"siedemdziesiat\", \"osiemdziesiat\", \"dziewiecdziesiat\"\n\nCompound numbers are constructed similarly to English: tens + units. For example, 22 is \"dwadziescia dwa\".\n\n\"One\" could be male (\"Jeden\"), female (\"Jedna\") or neuter (\"Jedno\"), which is the case for \"beer\" (piwo). But all other numbers are invariant, even if ending with \"jeden\".\n\nAh, and by the way, if you don't want to drink alcohol (so no beers are ordered), ask for mineral water instead: \"Woda mineralna\".\n\nNote: if the number of beers is outside your (limited) Polish knowledge (0-99), raise an error!\n\n---\nMore about the crazy polish grammar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_grammar\n\n<scaffold>\ndef ordering_beers(*args):\n    # Implement this function\n    # Make sure to change the signature to match the problem definition\n    pass\n\n# Test cases for ordering_beers\n# Print TEST_PASS or TEST_FAIL for each test, the `submit` tool will check for TEST_FAIL in the output\nfor i, gold in [([0], ['Woda mineralna poprosze']), ([1], ['Jedno piwo poprosze']), ([2], ['Dwa piwa poprosze']), ([3], ['Trzy piwa poprosze']), ([4], ['Cztery piwa poprosze']), ([5], ['Piec piw poprosze']), ([8], ['Osiem piw poprosze']), ([10], ['Dziesiec piw poprosze']), ([11], ['Jedenascie piw poprosze']), ([12], ['Dwanascie piw poprosze']), ([13], ['Trzynascie piw poprosze']), ([14], ['Czternascie piw poprosze']), ([15], ['Pietnascie piw poprosze']), ([16], ['Szesnascie piw poprosze']), ([20], ['Dwadziescia piw poprosze']), ([21], ['Dwadziescia jeden piw poprosze']), ([22], ['Dwadziescia dwa piwa poprosze']), ([28], ['Dwadziescia osiem piw poprosze']), ([33], ['Trzydziesci trzy piwa poprosze']), ([44], ['Czterdziesci cztery piwa poprosze']), ([55], ['Piecdziesiat piec piw poprosze']), ([98], ['Dziewiecdziesiat osiem piw poprosze']), ([99], ['Dziewiecdziesiat dziewiec piw poprosze'])]:\n    o = ordering_beers(*i)\n    if o == gold or [o] == gold: # Handle golds wrapped in a list\n        print(\"TEST_PASS\", i)\n    else:\n        print(\"TEST_FAIL\", i, \":\", o, \"!=\", gold)\n\n</scaffold>"}]}

A 24-bit message could be put on a 4x6 grid like so:\n\n\n>1 0 1 0 0 1\n>1 0 0 1 0 0\n>0 1 1 1 0 1\n>1 0 0 0 0 1\n\nThen, Parity bits are computed for each row and for each column, equal to 1 if there is an odd number of 1s in the row of column, and 0 if it is an even number. The result for the above message looks like:\n\n\n>1 0 1 0 0 1 1\n>1 0 0 1 0 0 0\n>0 1 1 1 0 1 0\n>1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n>1 1 0 0 0 1\n\nSince the 1st row, and 1st, 2nd and 6th column each have an odd number of 1s in them, and the others all do not.\n\nThen the whole message is sent, including the parity bits.

Do not use markdown code blocks."}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Overview\nResistors are electrical components marked with colorful stripes/bands to indicate both their resistance value in ohms and how tight a tolerance that value has. If you did my Resistor Color Codes kata, you wrote a function which took a string containing a resistor's band colors, and returned a string identifying the resistor's ohms and tolerance values.\n\n\nWell, now you need that in reverse: The previous owner of your \"Beyond-Ultimate Raspberry Pi Starter Kit\" (as featured in my Fizz Buzz Cuckoo Clock kata) had emptied all the tiny labeled zip-lock bags of components into the box, so that for each resistor you need for a project, instead of looking for text on a label, you need to find one with the sequence of band colors that matches the ohms value you need.\n\n## The resistor color codes\nYou can see this Wikipedia page for a colorful chart, but the basic resistor color codes are:\n\n0: black, 1: brown, 2: red, 3: orange, 4: yellow, 5: green, 6: blue, 7: violet, 8: gray, 9: white\n\nAll resistors have at least three bands, with the first and second bands indicating the first two digits of the ohms value, and the third indicating the power of ten to multiply them by, for example a resistor with a value of 47 ohms, which equals 47 * 10^0 ohms, would have the three bands \"yellow violet black\".\n\nMost resistors also have a fourth band indicating tolerance -- in an electronics kit like yours, the tolerance will always be 5%, which is indicated by a gold band. So in your kit, the 47-ohm resistor in the above paragraph would have the four bands \"yellow violet black gold\".\n\n## Your mission\nYour function will receive a string containing the ohms value you need, followed by a space and the word \"ohms\" (to avoid Codewars unicode headaches I'm just using the word instead of the ohms unicode symbol). The way an ohms value is formatted depends on the magnitude of the value:\n\n* For resistors less than 1000 ohms, the ohms value is just formatted as the plain number. For example, with the 47-ohm resistor above, your function would receive the string `\"47 ohms\"`, and return the string `\"yellow violet black gold\".\n\n* For resistors greater than or equal to 1000 ohms, but less than 1000000 ohms, the ohms value is divided by 1000, and has a lower-case \"k\" after it. For example, if your function received the string `\"4.7k ohms\"`, it would need to return the string `\"yellow violet red gold\"`.\n\n* For resistors of 1000000 ohms or greater, the ohms value is divided by 1000000, and has an upper-case \"M\" after it. For example, if your function received the string `\"1M ohms\"`, it would need to return the string `\"brown black green gold\"`. \n\nTest case resistor values will all be between 10 ohms and 990M ohms.\n\n## More examples, featuring some common resistor values from your kit\n```\n\"10 ohms\"        \"brown black black gold\"\n\"100 ohms\"       \"brown black brown gold\"\n\"220 ohms\"       \"red red brown gold\"\n\"330 ohms\"       \"orange orange brown gold\"\n\"470 ohms\"       \"yellow violet brown gold\"\n\"680 ohms\"       \"blue gray brown gold\"\n\"1k ohms\"        \"brown black red gold\"\n\"10k ohms\"       \"brown black orange gold\"\n\"22k ohms\"       \"red red orange gold\"\n\"47k ohms\"       \"yellow violet orange gold\"\n\"100k ohms\"      \"brown black yellow gold\"\n\"330k ohms\"      \"orange orange yellow gold\"\n\"2M ohms\"        \"red black green gold\"\n```\n\nHave fun!\n\n<scaffold>\ndef encode_resistor_colors(*args):\n    # Implement this function\n    # Make sure to change the signature to match the problem definition\n    pass\n\n# Test cases for encode_resistor_colors\n# Print TEST_PASS or TEST_FAIL for each test, the `submit` tool will check for TEST_FAIL in the output\nfor i, gold in [(['10 ohms'], ['brown black black gold']), (['47 ohms'], ['yellow violet black gold']), (['100 ohms'], ['brown black brown gold']), (['220 ohms'], ['red red brown gold']), (['330 ohms'], ['orange orange brown gold']), (['470 ohms'], ['yellow violet brown gold']), (['680 ohms'], ['blue gray brown gold']), (['1k ohms'], ['brown black red gold']), (['4.7k ohms'], ['yellow violet red gold']), (['10k ohms'], ['brown black orange gold']), (['22k ohms'], ['red red orange gold']), (['47k ohms'], ['yellow violet orange gold']), (['100k ohms'], ['brown black yellow gold']), (['330k ohms'], ['orange orange yellow gold']), (['1M ohms'], ['brown black green gold']), (['2M ohms'], ['red black green gold'])]:\n    o = encode_resistor_colors(*i)\n    if o == gold or [o] == gold: # Handle golds wrapped in a list\n        print(\"TEST_PASS\", i)\n    else:\n        print(\"TEST_FAIL\", i, \":\", o, \"!=\", gold)\n\n</scaffold>"}]}

This is in between the opening and closing tags.\nAnd the closing tag, which is an opening angle bracket, a forward slash, the name of the tag, and a closing angle bracket\n\n\nIf you were to have multiple attributes, they would each appear with a single space separating them\n\nSome tags do not require a closing tag.

If no element content is given, the return value will be expected to be a self-closing tag.  If more than one argument is given as element content, you will return multiple of the same element, just with different element content, separated by one or more newline characters.\nEx: \n\n<p class=\"paragraph-text\" id=\"example\">Hello World!</p>\\n<p class=\"paragraph-text\" id=\"example\">This is HTML code!</p>\n\nIMPORTANT:  Because class is a python keyword, and class is a very important HTML attribute, you will also have to implement a keyword argument named cls, as opposed to class.  This attribute will appear as class=\"variable\" in the return value of your function\nAny other keyword arguments of the function will be treated as attributes of the element.

This function has to performe the nth iteration of the **Rule 30** with the given input.\n\nThe rule to derive a cell from itself and its neigbour is:\n\nCurrent cell  | 000 | 001 | 010 | 011 | 100 | 101 | 110 | 111\n:-------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:\n **New cell** |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0 \n \n\nAs you can see the new state of a certain cell depends on his neighborhood. In *Current cells* you have the *nth* cell with his left and right neighbor, for example the first configuration is **000**:\n\n* left neighbor = 0\n* current cell = 0\n* right neighbor = 0\n\nThe result for the current cell is **0**, as reported in **New cell** row.\n\nYou also have to pay attention to the following things:\n\n* the borders of the list are always 0\n* values different from 0 and 1 must be considered as 0\n* a negative number of iteration never changes the initial sequence\n* you have to return an array of 0 and 1\n\nHere a small example step by step, starting from the list **[1]** and iterating for 5 times:\n\n* We have only one element so first of all we have to follow the rules adding the border, so the result will be **[0, 1, 0]**\n* Now we can apply the rule 30 to all the elements and the result will be **[1, 1, 1]** (first iteration)\n* Then, after continuing this way for 4 times, the result will be **[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]**\n\nIn Python, you can also use a support function to print the sequence named printRule30. This function takes as parameters the current list of 0 and 1 to print, the max level that you can reach (number of iterations) and the length of initial array.\n\n```python\ndef printRule30(list_, maxLvl, startLen):\n  ...\n```\n\nThe last two parameters are optional and are useful if you are printing each line of the iteration to center the result like this:\n\n\u2591\u2591\u2593\u2591\u2591  -> step 1  \n\u2591\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2591  -> step 2  \n\u2593\u2593\u2591\u2591\u2593  -> step 3  \n\nIf you pass only the array of 0 and 1 the previous result for each line will be like this:\n\n\u2593 -> step 1   \n\u2593\u2593\u2593 -> step 2  \n\u2593\u2593\u2591\u2591\u2593 -> step 3 \n\n**Note:** the function can print only the current list that you pass to it, so you have to use it in the proper way during the interactions of the rule 30.\n\n<scaffold>\ndef rule30(*args):\n    # Implement this function\n    # Make sure to change the signature to match the problem definition\n    pass\n\n# Test cases for rule30\n# Print TEST_PASS or TEST_FAIL for each test, the `submit` tool will check for TEST_FAIL in the output\nfor i, gold in [([[1], 1], [[1, 1, 1]]), ([[1], 2], [[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]]), ([[1], 21], [[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]]), ([[0], 5], [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]), ([[0], 0], [[0]]), ([[1, 1, 1], 0], [[1, 1, 1]]), ([[0], 3], [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]), ([[1], -3], [[1]]), ([[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], 1], [[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]), ([[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], 75], [[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]])]:\n    o = rule30(*i)\n    if o == gold or [o] == gold: # Handle golds wrapped in a list\n        print(\"TEST_PASS\", i)\n    else:\n        print(\"TEST_FAIL\", i, \":\", o, \"!=\", gold)\n\n</scaffold>"}]}

Your version will provide the same functionality, but will additionally add right, and justified padding of string -- the `super_pad`.\n\nYour function `super_pad` should take three arguments: the string `string`, the width of the final string `width`, and a fill character `fill`. However, the fill character can be enriched with a format string resulting in different padding strategies. If `fill` begins with `'<'` the string is padded on the left with the remaining fill string and if `fill` begins with `'>'` the string is padded on the right. Finally, if `fill` begins with `'^'` the string is padded on the left and the right, where the left padding is always greater or equal to the right padding. The `fill` string can contain more than a single char, of course. \n\nSome examples to clarify the inner workings:\n\n- `super_pad(\"test\", 10)` returns \"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0test\"\n- `super_pad(\"test\", 10, \"x\")` returns `\"xxxxxxtest\"`\n- `super_pad(\"test\", 10, \"xO\")` returns `\"xOxOxOtest\"`\n- `super_pad(\"test\", 10, \"xO-\")` returns `\"xO-xO-test\"`\n- `super_pad(\"some other test\", 10, \"nope\")` returns `\"other test\"`\n- `super_pad(\"some other test\", 10, \"> \")` returns `\"some other\"`\n- `super_pad(\"test\", 7, \">nope\")` returns `\"testnop\"`\n- `super_pad(\"test\", 7, \"^more complex\")` returns `\"motestm\"`\n- `super_pad(\"test\", 7, \"\")` returns `\"test\"`\n\nThe `super_pad` method always returns a string of length `width` if possible.

As sworn loyal subjects to the time elemental, Chronixus, both Solomon and Goromon were granted the power to create temporal folds. By sliding through these temporal folds, one can gain entry to parallel dimensions where time moves relatively faster or slower.\n\nGoromon grew dissatisfied and one day betrayed Chronixus by stealing the Temporal Crystal, an artifact used to maintain the time continuum. Chronixus summoned Solomon and gave him the task of tracking down Goromon and retrieving the Temporal Crystal.\n\nUsing a map given to Solomon by Chronixus, you must find Goromon's precise location.\n\nMission Details\n---------------\nThe map is represented as a 2D array. See the example below:\n\n```python\nmap_example = [[1,3,5],[2,0,10],[-3,1,4],[4,2,4],[1,1,5],[-3,0,12],[2,1,12],[-2,2,6]]\n```\nHere are what the values of each subarray represent:\n- **Time Dilation:** With each additional layer of time dilation entered, time slows by a factor of `2`. At layer `0`, time passes normally. At layer `1`, time passes at half the rate of layer `0`. At layer `2`, time passes at half the rate of layer `1`, and therefore one quarter the rate of layer `0`.\n- **Directions** are as follow: `0 = North, 1 = East, 2 = South, 3 = West`\n- **Distance Traveled:** This represents the distance traveled relative to the current time dilation layer. See below:\n\n```\nThe following are equivalent distances (all equal a Standard Distance of 100):\nLayer: 0, Distance: 100\nLayer: 1, Distance: 50\nLayer: 2, Distance: 25\n```\nFor the `mapExample` above:\n```\nmapExample[0] -> [1,3,5]\n1 represents the level shift of time dilation\n3 represents the direction\n5 represents the distance traveled relative to the current time dilation layer\n\nSolomon's new location becomes [-10,0]\n\nmapExample[1] -> [2,0,10]\nAt this point, Solomon has shifted 2 layers deeper.\nHe is now at time dilation layer 3.\nSolomon moves North a Standard Distance of 80.\nSolomon's new location becomes [-10,80]\n\nmapExample[2] -> [-3,1,4]\nAt this point, Solomon has shifted out 3 layers.\nHe is now at time dilation layer 0.\nSolomon moves East a Standard Distance of 4.\nSolomon's new location becomes [-6,80]\n```\nYour function should return Goromon's `[x,y]` coordinates.\n\nFor `mapExample`, the correct output is `[346,40]`.\n\nAdditional Technical Details\n----------------------------\n- Inputs are always valid.\n- Solomon begins his quest at time dilation level `0`, at `[x,y]` coordinates `[0,0]`.\n- Time dilation level at any point will always be `0` or greater.\n- Standard Distance is the distance at time dilation level `0`.\n- For given distance `d` for each value in the array: `d >= 0`.\n- Do not mutate the input\n\n**Note from the author:** I made up this story for the purpose of this kata.

The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984. Pajitnov derived its name from combining the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (the falling pieces contain 4 segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport.\n\n# About scoring system\n\nThe scoring formula is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear is worth `40` points, clearing four lines at once (known as a Tetris) is worth `1200`.\n\nA level multiplier is also used. The game starts at level `0`. The level increases every ten lines you clear. Note that after increasing the level, the total number of cleared lines is not reset.\n\nFor our task you can use this table:\n\n\n        .demo {\n    width:70%;\n                border:1px solid #C0C0C0;\n                border-collapse:collapse;\n                padding:5px;\n        }\n        .demo th {\n                border:1px solid #C0C0C0;\n                padding:5px;\n        }\n        .demo td {\n                border:1px solid #C0C0C0;\n                padding:5px;\n        }\n\n\n\nLevel\nPoints for 1 line\nPoints for 2 lines\nPoints for 3 lines\nPoints for 4 lines\n\n\n0\n40\n100\n300\n1200\n\n\n1\n80\n200\n600\n2400\n\n\n2\n120\n300\n900\n3600\n\n\n3\n160\n400\n1200\n4800\n\n\n...\n\n\n7\n320\n800\n2400\n9600\n\n\n...\nFor level n you must determine the formula by yourself using given examples from the table.\n\n\n\n# Task\n\nCalculate the final score of the game using original Nintendo scoring system\n\n# Input\n\nArray with cleaned lines.  \nExample: `[4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2]`  \nInput will always be valid: array of random length (from `0` to `5000`) with numbers from `0` to `4`.\n\n# Ouput\n\nCalculated final score.  \n`def get_score(arr) -> int: return 0`\n\n# Example\n```python\nget_score([4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2]); # returns 4900\n```\nStep 1: `+1200` points for 4 lines (current level `0`).

Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition. If order matters, the sum becomes a composition.

The subfamily contains about 25 species, classified in six or seven genera. They have become established as popular small house pets, and, partly because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as laboratory animals.\n\n\n# Task \n\nWrite a function that accepts two inputs: `code` and `message` and returns an encrypted string from `message` using the `code`.   \nThe `code` is a string that generates the key in the way shown below:\n\n```\n 1  | h a m s t e r\n 2  | i b n   u f\n 3  | j c o   v g\n 4  | k d p   w\n 5  | l   q   x\n 6  |         y\n 7  |         z\n\n```\n\nAll letters from `code` get number `1`. All letters which directly follow letters from `code` get number `2` (unless they already have a smaller number assigned), etc. It's difficult to describe but it should be easy to understand from the example below:\n\n```\n 1  | a e h m r s t\n 2  | b f i n     u\n 3  | c g j o     v\n 4  | d   k p     w\n 5  |     l q     x\n 6  |             y\n 7  |             z\n\n```\n\nHow does the encoding work using the `hamster` code?    \n\n```\na => a1\nb => a2\nc => a3\nd => a4\ne => e1\nf => e2\n...\n```\n\nAnd applying it to strings :\n\n```\nhamsterMe('hamster', 'hamster')   => h1a1m1s1t1e1r1\nhamsterMe('hamster', 'helpme')    => h1e1h5m4m1e1\n\n```\n\nAnd you probably started wondering what will happen if there is no `a` in the `code`.  \nJust add these letters after the last available letter (in alphabetic order) in the `code`.\n\nThe key for code `hmster` is:\n```\n 1  | e h m r s t\n 2  | f i n     u\n 3  | g j o     v\n 4  |   k p     w\n 5  |   l q     x\n 6  |           y\n 7  |           z\n 8  |           a\n 9  |           b\n10  |           c\n11  |           d\n```\n\n# Additional notes\n\nThe `code` will have at least 1 letter.   \nDuplication of letters in `code` is possible and should be handled.    \nThe `code` and `message` consist of only lowercase letters.\n\n<scaffold>\ndef hamster_me(*args):\n    # Implement this function\n    # Make sure to change the signature to match the problem definition\n    pass\n\n# Test cases for hamster_me\n# Print TEST_PASS or TEST_FAIL for each test, the `submit` tool will check for TEST_FAIL in the output\nfor i, gold in [(['hamster', 'hamster'], ['h1a1m1s1t1e1r1']), (['hamster', 'helpme'], ['h1e1h5m4m1e1']), (['hmster', 'hamster'], ['h1t8m1s1t1e1r1']), (['hhhhammmstteree', 'hamster'], ['h1a1m1s1t1e1r1']), (['f', 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'], ['f22f23f24f25f26f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9f10f11f12f13f14f15f16f17f18f19f20f21'])]:\n    o = hamster_me(*i)\n    if o == gold or [o] == gold: # Handle golds wrapped in a list\n        print(\"TEST_PASS\", i)\n    else:\n        print(\"TEST_FAIL\", i, \":\", o, \"!=\", gold)\n\n</scaffold>"}]}

This is represented by the **atomic number** which is noted by an integer number next to or above each element of the periodic table (as highlighted in the image above).\n\nAs we move from left to right, starting from the top row of the periodic table, each element differs from its predecessor by 1 unit (electron). Electrons fill in different orbitals sets according to a specific order. Each set of orbitals, when full, contains an even number of electrons.\n\nThe orbital sets are:\n* The _**s** orbital_ - a single orbital that can hold a maximum of 2 electrons.\n* The _**p** orbital set_ - can hold 6 electrons.\n* The _**d** orbital set_ - can hold 10 electrons.\n* The _**f** orbital set_ - can hold 14 electrons.\n\n\nThe order in which electrons are filling the different set of orbitals is shown in the picture above. First electrons will occupy the **1s** orbital, then the **2s**, then the **2p** set, **3s** and so on.\n\nElectron configurations show how the number of electrons of an element is distributed across each orbital set. Each orbital is written as a sequence that follows the order in the picture, joined by the number of electrons contained in that orbital set. The final electron configuration is a single string of orbital names and number of electrons per orbital set where the first 2 digits of each substring represent the orbital name followed by a number that states the number of electrons that the orbital set contains.\n\nFor example, a string that demonstrates an electron configuration of a chemical element that contains 10 electrons is: `1s2 2s2 2p6`. This configuration shows that there are two electrons in the `1s` orbital set, two electrons in the `2s` orbital set, and six electrons in the `2p` orbital set. `2 + 2 + 6 = 10` electrons total.\n\n___\n\n# Task\n\nYour task is to write a function that displays the electron configuration built according to the Madelung rule of all chemical elements of the periodic table. The argument will be the symbol of a chemical element, as displayed in the periodic table.\n\n**Note**: There will be a preloaded array called `ELEMENTS` with chemical elements sorted by their atomic number.\n\nFor example, when the element \"O\" is fed into the function the output should look like: \n\n`\"O -> 1s2 2s2 2p4\"`\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions! The electron configurations of the elements below should end as:\n\n```\nCr -> ...3d5 4s1\nCu -> ...3d10 4s1\nNb -> ...4d4 5s1\nMo -> ...4d5 5s1\nRu -> ...4d7 5s1\nRh -> ...4d8 5s1\nPd -> ...4d10 5s0\nAg -> ...4d10 5s1\nLa -> ...4f0 5d1\nCe -> ...4f1 5d1\nGd -> ...4f7 5d1 6s2\nPt -> ...4f14 5d9 6s1\nAu -> ...4f14 5d10 6s1\nAc -> ...5f0 6d1 7s2\nTh -> ...5f0 6d2 7s2\nPa -> ...5f2 6d1 7s2\nU  -> ...5f3 6d1 7s2\nNp -> ...5f4 6d1 7s2\nCm -> ...5f7 6d1 7s2\n```\n\n**Note**: for `Ni` the electron configuration should be `3d8 4s2` instead of `3d9 4s1`.\n\n<scaffold>\ndef get_electron_configuration(*args):\n    # Implement this function\n    # Make sure to change the signature to match the problem definition\n    pass\n\n# Test cases for get_electron_configuration\n# Print TEST_PASS or TEST_FAIL for each test, the `submit` tool will check for TEST_FAIL in the output\nfor i, gold in [(['H'], ['H -> 1s1']), (['Cr'], ['Cr -> 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s1']), (['C'], ['C -> 1s2 2s2 2p2']), (['Br'], ['Br -> 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2 4p5']), (['V'], ['V -> 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d3 4s2'])]:\n    o = get_electron_configuration(*i)\n    if o == gold or [o] == gold: # Handle golds wrapped in a list\n        print(\"TEST_PASS\", i)\n    else:\n        print(\"TEST_FAIL\", i, \":\", o, \"!=\", gold)\n\n</scaffold>"}]}

These addresses can be calculated using a bitwise AND operation on each bit.\n\n(The broadcast address is not used in this kata.)\n\n## Example\nA computer on a simple home network might have the following IP and subnet mask:\n```\nIP: 192.168.2.1\nSubnet: 255.255.255.0\n(CIDR Notation: 192.168.2.1 /24)\n```\nIn this example, the network block is: **192.168.2.0**. And the host identifier is: **0.0.0.1**. \n\n## bitwise AND \nTo calculate the network block and host identifier the bits in each octet are ANDed together.
